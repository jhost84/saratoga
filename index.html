    <!-- Chosen Palette: Saratoga Silk -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed as a "Handicapper's Hub." The main view is a dashboard presenting the most critical, high-level betting advice: Top Win Bets, Live Longshots, Horizontal Keys, and Favorites to Fade. This allows users to get the day's core strategy at a glance. A prominent navigation bar allows users to select any race (1-10) to dive deeper. The race detail view is a two-column layout. The left column contains an interactive speed figure comparison chart (using Chart.js) and the race overview. The right column features a scrollable list of "Horse Cards," one for each runner, containing detailed analysis (Pace, Class, Form, etc.). This structure was chosen because it mirrors a bettor's workflow: get the big picture first, then drill down into specific races and horses. It prioritizes quick access to actionable insights while keeping detailed data organized and accessible. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Top Picks/Longshots -> Goal: Quick Insight -> Viz: Styled summary cards with icons (ðŸ”‘, ðŸ’£, ðŸŽ¯, ðŸš«) -> Interaction: None, purely informational -> Justification: Provides immediate, scannable access to the report's most important conclusions. | Report Info: Speed Figures per race -> Goal: Compare top contenders -> Viz: Horizontal Bar Chart (Chart.js) -> Interaction: Hover for tooltips -> Justification: Allows for easy visual comparison of the key quantitative metric (speed) for the main contenders. | Report Info: Detailed horse analysis -> Goal: In-depth understanding -> Viz: Structured HTML "Horse Cards" with clear headings -> Interaction: Scrolling -> Justification: Organizes dense qualitative analysis into a digestible, consistent format for every horse in a race. | Report Info: Race Navigation -> Goal: Move between races -> Viz: Numbered button bar -> Interaction: Click to update all content -> Justification: Simple, intuitive navigation familiar to any racing fan. -->
