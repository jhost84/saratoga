    <!-- Chosen Palette: Saratoga Sage & Slate -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed around a central dashboard for immediate, high-level insights (Top Bets, Longshots, Fades), which serves as the landing page. This caters to users seeking quick, actionable information. From there, a clear top navigation allows users to select a specific race. Each race view uses a tabbed interface ('Analysis', 'Pace Scenario', 'Top Contenders') to segment the complex information, preventing cognitive overload from a long scroll. This structured, hierarchical approach—from dashboard summary to race-specific details—allows users to explore at their preferred depth, making the dense report content highly digestible and user-friendly. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Daily Betting Angles (Top Bets, Fades, etc.) -> Goal: Inform/Summarize -> Viz/Method: HTML/Tailwind Cards -> Interaction: Clickable cards to navigate to the race -> Justification: Provides a scannable, high-impact summary on the main dashboard.
        - Report Info: Pace analysis (running styles) -> Goal: Compare/Organize -> Viz/Method: Chart.js Horizontal Bar Chart -> Interaction: Hover tooltips on bars -> Justification: Visually groups horses by running style (Speed, Presser, Closer), making the pace setup instantly understandable.
        - Report Info: Trainer/Jockey stats -> Goal: Compare -> Viz/Method: Chart.js Vertical Bar Chart -> Interaction: Hover tooltips -> Justification: Quantifies the "trainer angle" with clear, comparative data.
        - Report Info: Betting Strategy (Contenders, Wagers) -> Goal: Inform/Organize -> Viz/Method: Structured HTML/Tailwind cards with icons -> Interaction: None -> Justification: Clearly delineates win contenders, longshots, and fades with supporting rationale in a clean, organized layout.
