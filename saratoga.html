    <!-- Chosen Palette: Exacta AI (Navy, Electric Blue, Slate) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as a dashboard to prioritize user-centric exploration over the report's linear format. The initial view presents a high-level "Executive Summary" with the most actionable bets (Prime Bet, Value Plays, Fades), allowing users to immediately grasp key opportunities. A persistent navigation bar enables non-linear access to any of the eight races. Clicking a race dynamically updates the main content area with a detailed analysis for that specific race. This structure was chosen because horseplayers value efficiency; they need to quickly identify top plays and then drill down for justification, rather than being forced to read a long document sequentially. The core of this design is the dynamic rendering of race data, including an interactive chart, into a consistent template, which enhances usability and comparison. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Probability vs. Price analysis for key horses. -> Goal: Visually compare the handicapper's assessed win probability against the market's implied probability to instantly identify value (overlays) or risk (underlays). -> Viz/Presentation Method: A grouped bar chart (Chart.js/Canvas) for each race. -> Interaction: On hover, tooltips display precise odds, implied probability, and assessed probability. -> Justification: A chart is far more effective and immediate for comparing quantitative data than a table or text, directly supporting the report's central theme of "Price x Probability = Value". Report Info: Pace Projection. -> Goal: Quickly convey the expected race shape. -> Viz/Presentation Method: Color-coded HTML tags (e.g., red for "Pressured Duel"). -> Justification: Visual tags provide at-a-glance information that is faster to process than a sentence. Report Info: Wager construction. -> Goal: Clearly present betting strategies. -> Viz/Presentation Method: Structured HTML lists. -> Justification: Clean, scannable lists are ideal for actionable instructions. -> Library/Method: Chart.js for charts, Tailwind/HTML for all other visual elements. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
